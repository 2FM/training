The hint says "The correct prediction" 

== Solution 

First there is a login, dont botter it doesn't even work so as last challenge we search in the source code for something that gives us a hint, just run the obfuscated javascript founded in the source code, then that will give us a combination of user and pass in md5 encryption, so now is just looking for a hash killer and get the password from an user that looks suspicious. The go back to the login and IGNORE it, just put the password from the wierd user and that's it.
