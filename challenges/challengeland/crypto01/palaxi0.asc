== Vigenere cipher

This is a code made with a vigenere cipher which consist in a cipher with a key using a table with the key.
So first we will use this http://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx[tool] to figure oout the length of the key, so try every length until something makes sense.
Now using the same tool put the key and run it again. 

That's it.
