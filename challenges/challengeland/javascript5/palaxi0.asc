The hint says "The correct prediction" 

== Solution 

First looking at the code we find a .js file where the script is, we find that the javascript is ofuscated but we still are able to run the code at the js console in the browser.
It returns "bad /".

There's two ways of going through this obfuscate javascript:

1. Follow the code as it is and find out what to return instead of what is being returned.
2. Transform the javascript code so it can be read ease and fix the return.

The fixed return is the answer. Be careful there are two possible answers :)
