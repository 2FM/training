== Canyouhackit Web Based Challenge 9

=== Solution 

Here we got a tricky challenge, the url is very alike with challenge 6, so enter into the path given by the url. Now we are at the index and again there is a passconfigs.php file which will gives us answers. Load the file with the url given at first. It says no file found, but here is where the magic happens and we will add a null byte at the end so it wont end at .php but will look for this file as txt like this.
"files9/passconfigs.php%00" so the program will recognize it as "files9/passconfigs.php%00.txt" and will load what is in there as text. The answer is right there.
