== Canyouhackit Web Based Challenge 5

=== Solution

Here is a page with a field that apparently doesn't do anything. So checkin the url there coul be a posible inyection. Try it with a ' at the end and we got the mysql error, so lets try the most basic bypass query, 
'or '1' = '1' -- '
There we have a change at the fields from guest to admin and the password is right there, so lets take a look at the source code, the value of that password field is our key to complete this challenge.
