= This is legal Challenge 10

== Solution

So we must bypass a flash login, in order to do that we need to use the flasm tool, in this case i use it in linux.
First we need to get the login page itself by loading the flash login in another tab. Then:
[source, bash]
----
wget www.thisislegal.com/password.swf
flasm -d password.swf | grep push
----

Now we have all the fields the login is comparing, in one of them is the answer to the login, use it and that's it.
