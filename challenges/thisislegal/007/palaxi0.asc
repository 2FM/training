== This is legal Challenge7

=== Solution

For this challenge we first need to know how to hack a FrontPage site, so if you like me don't have any idea where to begin then lets check the hint "Vermeer Technology Inc".

When i googled that the first page i got was http://www.ouah.org/hfag.txt[this one] where they explain how a company made a web server hosting web pages, but they let open a serious backdoor letting you hack the site real quick. So if you, like me, don't have any idea of FrontPageServerExtensions i fully recomend to read this article.

Now going on, as the web page is hosted in that web server we need to find the backdoor where the vulnerability could get exploted. So let's take a look at the path where the files are storage, the 
http://www.thisislegal.com/challenge7/_vti_pvt/[_vti_pvt folder].

Now look the file administrator.pwd so we know what's next.
admin:dut4HlQyu4dSA

Now just using John the reaper lets crack the password, once we got it log in into the challenge page and there we got it.
