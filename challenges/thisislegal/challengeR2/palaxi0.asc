= This is legal Challenge Realistic 2

== Solution

We have this page which has a login link, go there and use the most simple sql injection, admin as username and in the password 'or''='-- -. Then there's a database which contains the superadmin credentials, then the password appears to be a md5 hash because of the length of the hash.
Go to a decrypt hash tool and put it there. Now log as superadmin and the password you got. Challenge solved.
