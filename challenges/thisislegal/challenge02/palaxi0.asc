= This is legal Challenge 2

== Solution

We need to break a JavaScript login, so check the source code if there is any javascript validation that is being done at the client side, FrontEnd, eventually we find what we are looking for and there is the plain text with the javascript credential validation, so identify both login and password credentials and there you go.
