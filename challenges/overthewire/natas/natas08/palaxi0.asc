= Over the wire natas 8

This set of natas challenge were solved at web.

== Solution

There's the source code which shows us a php code that takes the input and makes 3 things, encode it in base64 then invert it then convert it from bin to hexadecimal, so we revert the process using 

[source, php]
----
$variable = base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin(stringhere)));
echo $variable;
----

And we have our password once we put the result of the above operation into the input secret.
