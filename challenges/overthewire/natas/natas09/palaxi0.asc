== Solution

This challenge is about getting the password using a search word that works as linux console. So using any word and ";" and then use any command it will be usefull to search the password. 
Almost all passwords are located at "etc" folder so everything after this is how to get to the password.

[source, bash]
----
;ls /etc/
;ls /etc/natas_webpass/
; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas9
