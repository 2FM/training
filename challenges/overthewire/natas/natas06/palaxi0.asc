= Over the wire natas 6

This set of natas challenge were solved at web.

== Solution

So in here we find a php script which validates a password and let us in if is right, the script include a path "includes/secret.inc", so we use it to see what's there, in fact there's a string, use it in the original input field and send the secret, that's it.
