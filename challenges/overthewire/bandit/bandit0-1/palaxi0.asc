= Over the wire Bandit 0-1

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

We are given an ssh user and password so we can login and start the level of the challenge, so login with ssh "bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org", and now there's a readme file, so "cat readme" and there is your password for accesing the next level.
