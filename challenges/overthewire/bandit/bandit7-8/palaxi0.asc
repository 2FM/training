= Over the wire Bandit 7-8

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

There is a password stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth so use the cat plus grep with this one.

"cat data.txt | grep 'millionth' "

There we have the password.
