= Over the wire Bandit 12-13

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

In this challenge we need to manage a file that has been compressed several times, and in a txt they show us the hexdump of the file, so lets take it again to a binary way so we can manipulate it and start decompress over and over.
So let's begin taking the file to a temporal one in a binary form, go to the directory and open the file

[source, bash]
----
xxd -r data.txt>/tmp/hi/hi.txt
cd /tmp/hi
cat hi.txt
----

Now having the file, use "file hi.txt" to know the type of file we have, which is gzip, so change the extension using "mv hi.txt hi.gz" and there you go.
Now we use "gzip -d hi.gz" to decompress the file and again use the file command, so now we have a bzip2 fila so lets transform it into a format we can decompress, "mv hi hi.bz2" and "bzip2 -d hi.bz2".
Now again "file hi" and again "mv hi hi.gz" and "gzip -d hi.gz".
Now its a tar archive so "mv hi hi.tar" and then "tar xvf hi.tar".
There is a "data5.bin" file so we use "file data5.bin" and know that is a tar archive, so:

[source, bash]
----
mv data5.bin data5.tar
tar xvf data5.bin
----

Now we got a data6.bin archive and with file we know is a bzip2 compressed data so here we go again:

[source, bash]
----
mv data6.bin data6.bz2
bzip2 -d data6.bz2
file data6
----

Last line we figure that's a tar file, so repeat the "tar" part and we got "data8.bin", now "file data8.bin" and is a gzip, as this is the last part now i'll show the commands that follows.

[source, bash]
----
file data8.bin
mv data8.bin data.gz
gzip -d data.gz
file data
cat data
----

Now we got the password with the last step.
