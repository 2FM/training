= Over the wire Bandit 6-7

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

The challenge is about to find a file inside the server with this characteristics:
1. Owner user bandit7
2. Owner group bandit6 
3. Size 33 bytes

So with the above and in that order we look into the all server like this "find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c"
As there are a lots of results for the research because there are some directories we are not allowed to visit add a "grep" option so we can see in red(in my case) if there's any file that matches our grep description. 
That said "find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c | grep 'pass' ".
The file that results of research is the one we want to "cat", ant there is the password.
