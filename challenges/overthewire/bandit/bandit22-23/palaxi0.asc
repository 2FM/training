= Over the wire Bandit 22-23

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

So in here we have a similar procedure than the last level, access the folder where is storage the cron script. 

[source, bash]
----
cd /etc/cron.d/
cat cronjob_bandit23
----

Now we see there's a file which is being executed, see what's in there 

[source, bash]
----
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
----

Here the script is basically copying information in a file named after a variable called mytarget that uses other one called myname which is whoami comand and is the same than bandit23 where we are trying to access.

So what to do now is get mytarget value so we can access the correct file, so to do that we will eecute exactly the code in the script.

[source, bash]
----
echo Im user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
----

With that we have our file name. Now access with the path "cat /tmp/filename"

There is the password.
