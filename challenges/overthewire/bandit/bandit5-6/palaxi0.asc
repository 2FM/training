= Over the wire Bandit 5-6

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

We are suppose to find a file with the following characteristics:
1. Human readable
2. 1033 bytes in size
3. Not executable
4. Is localted in one of the multiple directories inside "inhere".

So for this we just apply a filter witht his characteristics, "find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable".
There's a path that leads to the file with the filter, so "cat" the path and that's it.
