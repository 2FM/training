= Over the wire Bandit 15-16

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

At this level we should conect to localhost on port 30001 using ssl encryption so now we do:

[source, bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof
----

Now put the password of this level and that should do the magic, last parameter is to ignore the end of line so it will stand by.
