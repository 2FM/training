= Over the wire Bandit 8-9

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

In the data.txt file the password is the one which repeat only once. 
"sort data.txt | uniq -c" So with this we organize all the lines in the file and count them by unique text line.
The password is the line with the 1 value.
