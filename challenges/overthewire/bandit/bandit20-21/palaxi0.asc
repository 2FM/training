= Over the wire Bandit 20-21

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

In this level we need to open two consoles, so we need to start a daemon network in one of them, and in the other we need to execute the setuid so it will connect and retrieve us the password if is the correct one. Let's begin:
At first console, log in and then:

[source, bash]
----
netcat -l -p 3230
----
This is for starting the network that will listen at port 3230, now write the password of the current level.

At second console:

[source, bash]
----
./suconnect 3230
----

Execute the setuid at the listening port and watch it retrieve the password.
