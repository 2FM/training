= Over the wire Bandit 14-15

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

Instructions are pretty clear, send the password of the actual level to port 30000 on localhost.

[source, bash]
----
telnet localhost 30000
----

Put there the password of this level and that's it.
