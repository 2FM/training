= Over the wire Bandit 2-3

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

First log using ssh so "ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" and the password we got last level. Use "ls" to see what's in the directory. Now there is a file with spaces on it's name. So we use the backslash to scape the space character, now use "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename" and there is the password.
