= Over the wire Bandit 21-22

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

So there's a script that runs automatically in intervals defined from cron, so take a look at what the script is doing.

[source, bash]
----
cd /etc/cron.d/
cat cronjob_bandit22
----

Now we know there's a file being executed so let's check that one too.

[source, bash]
----
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
----

Here we almost have the answer, cause what it does is saving what is in a file to a temp file, so check the file where the information is being saved. 

[source, bash]
----
cat /tmp/"name of file"
----

There is the password.
