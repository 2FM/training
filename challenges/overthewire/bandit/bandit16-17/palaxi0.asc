= Over the wire Bandit 16-17

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

So first says there is a port listening with ssl encryption so first we need to know which ports are, indeed, open with a port scan.
[source, bash]
----
nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
----

Now try every one of them until you got the correct one, ok i'll help 31790. So use the last ssl encryption conect way.

[source, bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof
----

Put the password and you will receive an RSA plain text key, now save it into a new file. Copy the key, all of it.

[source, bash]
----
cd /temp/
mkdir pass16
cd pass16/
nano sshkey.private
----
Copy there the key, and make the file private and secure. Then connect via ssh

[source, bash]
----
chmod 600 sshkey.private
ssh bandit17@localhost -i ssh.private
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
----

There's your password
