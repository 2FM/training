= Over the wire Bandit 11-12

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

At data.txt is the password with rot13 encryption so we reverse that using:
[source, bash]
----
cat data.txt | tr '[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]' '[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]'
----

That's it.
