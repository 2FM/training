= Over the wire Bandit 1-2

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

First log using ssh so "ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" put the password we got last level, now see what's in the level with "ls" and see a file called "-" so the cat command won't recognize that char as a file, we should put first "./" and then the "-" so it will read it so "./-". There is the password.
