= Over the wire Bandit 13-14

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

Here you need to log in into the next levelusing the ssh key the challenge gives us so we can access to a file in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, so lets do that.

[source, bash]
----
ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private
cat //etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
----

And there is the password.
