= Over the wire Bandit 19-20

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

There's an executable that has elevated priviledges to open some files, so let's see those priviledges.

[source, bash]
----
./bandit20-do id
----

Now we know who can execute this and which group is this belong to. So let's try to open the given path.

[source, bash]
----
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
----

There is the password.
