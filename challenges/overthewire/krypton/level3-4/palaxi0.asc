= Over The Wire Krypto4

Here is a trickier cipher that works with the repetition of characters.

== Solution

=== Vigenere decipher
 We have a hint that says 6 is the key len so we will use a vigenere count at www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/vignere.php[Vigenere] and the possible key is 'frekey', then use http://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx[Vigenere codebreaker] and use the key with the content of file krypton5, the password is the one displayed without spaces.
