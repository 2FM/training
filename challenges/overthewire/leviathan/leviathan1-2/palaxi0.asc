= Overthewire Leviathan 1-2

== Solution

Using the ls command we see there's an executable and once we start it it asks us a password, check with anything and go back, now use ltrace to see how is that working.

[source, bash]
----
ltrace ./check
----

Now you can see there's a "strcmp" between the string you put and "sex", so run it again and put "sex" as password, now we got a shell. Look for the password at the directory where they told us we should look.

[source, bash]
----
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
----

There's our password.
