= Overthewire Leviathan6-7

There is an executable that requires a 4 digit code so we are going to use bash to execute it because there's not a limit of bruteforce attemps.

[source, bash]
----
for i in {0000..9999}; do  echo $i & ./leviathan6 $i ; done
----

So now we wait until the shell let us in with one of the code ****, now just look into the path the page say are all the passwords. 

[source, bash]
----
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7 
----

That's it.
