== Solution

There's nothing when use the normal ls. Lets check the secret folders too, ls -a, and there's a folder called .backup.

[source, bash]
----
cd ./.backup/
ls -a
cat bookmarks.html
cat bookmarks.html | grep "pass"
----

So the 4 lines above do:
1. Change directory to enter into the backup one
2. Now check everythong there including hidden files or folders.
3. See what's in that file bookmarks
4. As there's a lot of information just check for something alike "pass"

In all text we got, the password is shown.
