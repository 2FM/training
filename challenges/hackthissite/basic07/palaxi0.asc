== Solution

There is a view option so you can load the calendar of the year you want, and beyond that is responds to a UNIX commands, so asumme that the year you are puting there is what a function is expecting. Just split the commands with normal ";" and try the "ls" command there like this:
-> 2016; ls
Now we see that the calendar of 2016 is displayed but there's also the files inside this same path we are on. Notice that there's a .php file that obviusly we can load as we are loading, what i think it is, the index.php.

That said load the other weird .php file at the url.

url/file.php

There's the password.
