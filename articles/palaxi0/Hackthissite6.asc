In this challenge we are supposed to decrypt an encripted key using the same script to encript that key.

== Ascii table 
This is the table we are going to use to know which ascii character is being represented after the encryption.

So the first step is taking a normal value that repeats itself at characters, so we can identify a clue of how the encoding is taking place.

== First test:

aaaaa
abcdef

Now we see how it works, depends on the position it gives us the "n" moved character, a in position 0 equal a, a in position 2 equals b because abcdefghijk..... etc so lets try to use the key given and return the character at n position at left.

9f2fe3b decrypted
9g4ii8h encrypted

As we know there are numbers, letters and especial characters, you should based the reverse encoding in the character position at the ascii table.
So here we go again.

9f2fe3b9
9g4ii8h@

There we have it.
